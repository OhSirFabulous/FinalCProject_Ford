FlipCalculator_Ford
Description:
A C# console program called FlipCalculator_Ford determines the earnings from forging items in Hypixel Skyblock. By incorporating real-time Bazaar API data, recipe cost breakdowns, Kuudra Key crafting logic, and NPC flipping strategies, it duplicates and enhances an earlier Google Sheets tool. The project demonstrates practical knowledge of command-driven user interfaces, API integration, and data handling.

Task 1 of the project is to set up the development environment.

opened Visual Studio Code and made a new C# project.

added the required JSON data files and adjusted the file structure.

Task 2: Create input structures and data models

Models for Kuudra Key materials, recipes, and bazaar goods were made.

JSON inputs that have been organized and verified for dynamic parsing

Task 3: Include the Hypixel Bazaar API

Asynchronous calls were added to retrieve real-time market prices.

NPC list of prices were used to implement caching and fallback logic.

Task 4: Develop fundamental commands for calculating profits

created commands for sorting profits and analyzing recipe costs.

Support for key tier breakdowns and quantity scaling has been implemented.

Task 5: Include more sophisticated features

developed a cost breakdown logic for Kuudra Key crafting.

Developed logic for detecting profitable NPC flips based on live purchase orders

Task 6: Examine, debug, and refine

checked all outputs and commands against the spreadsheet's findings.

Using modular fixes, compile-time and runtime problems were fixed.

Acquired Project Skills
Using C# to consume and process JSON APIs

Creating command-line interfaces that can be expanded

LINQ and dictionaries for effective data lookups

Using namespaces to organize C# applications with multiple files

Enhancing spreadsheet logic and transferring it to stand-alone software

C# is the language of choice because of its structure, type safety, and ability to support object-oriented programming and API consumption.

Utilizing an iterative development process with feature milestones, each command or feature was developed and tested separately, facilitating quick troubleshooting and modular updates.
